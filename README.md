<h2>Proposed Project Title: </h2>

<h3> Geospatial Analysis of Buffalo's Tree Species Distribution </h3>

<h2> Data Sources: </h2>

- The "Geospatial Analysis of Buffalo's Tree Species Distribution" is a data-driven project that uses open data tree inventory data to uncover trends in the distribution of tree species across Buffalo, NY. The study entails mapping the position of trees and analyzing their association with environmental parameters such asÂ climate using geospatial analysis. This project intends to provide significant insights into Buffalo's urban forest and influence decision-making regarding tree management and conservation by harnessing the extensive and detailed data supplied by the pendata buffalo tree inventory.

<h2>API Link: https://data.buffalony.gov/resource/n4ni-uuec.json  </h2>


<h2>Analysis Plan:</h2>

<ins> **Data Preparation</ins>:** Import the pendata buffalo tree inventory data into a Python environment and clean and preprocess the data as appropriate. This could include deleting duplicates, filling in blanks, and standardizing variable names. In addition, gather and preprocess any relevant geographical data sources, such as satellite imagery or land cover data.

<ins> **Data Exploration</ins>:** Perform preliminary exploratory data analysis to gain a better grasp of the data and to find any patterns or trends. Using tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, you may be able to create visualizations and summary statistics.

<ins> **Geospatial Analysis</ins>:** Map the distribution of tree species in Buffalo, NY using geospatial analysis libraries like Geopandas. This may entail developing thematic maps, such as heat maps, to display the quantity and distribution of various tree species throughout the city.

<ins> **Environmental Factor Analysis</ins>:** To detect any relationships with tree species distribution, utilize statistical libraries such as numpy and Scikit-learn to add environmental characteristics such as climate, soil type, and land use into the analysis. This could include employing regression analysis or clustering.

<ins> **Interpretation and Reporting</ins>:** Finally, assess the analysis results and report any findings. Using libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, this may entail constructing visuals and summary statistics to explain the data in a clear and intelligible manner.


<h2>Motivation:</h2>

<ins> **Conservation and Management</ins>:** The distribution of tree species in Buffalo can help guide conservation and management activities. Resources can be directed to where they are most needed by identifying locations with high or low abundance of specific species.

<ins> **Urban Planning</ins>:** Trees have various advantages in urban contexts, including improved air quality, reduced urban heat island effects, and aesthetic value. Understanding tree species distribution can assist urban planners in making informed decisions about where to plant trees and which species to prioritize.

<ins> **Climate Change Adaptation</ins>:** Understanding how tree species distribution may alter in the future will help inform adaptation measures as climate change continues to impact the planet.

<ins> **Public Engagement</ins>:** Mapping the distribution of tree species can help engage the public in learning and appreciating their city's natural resources. Citizens can become more aware of the worth of trees and the need of protecting them by sharing the results of the analysis.

<h2> Mitigation plan for activities that are in danger of delay:</h2>

-Each activity in this progress report has a due date, and the milestones are listed in chronological order. The status column shows whether a task has been done, not started, or is expecting a delay. </br>

-As of May 10th, data exploration will be in progress, and the plotting distribution of tree species is due on the same day. However, there is a risk of missing the May 10th deadline for plotting the distribution of tree species. To mitigate this delay, we can prioritize the analysis of species distribution by devoting more time to this work and, if required, limiting time spent on other activities.</br>

-As you can see there are some more activities in the milestone such as visualization, presentation, and report writing are expected to delay. So, in order to address these potential delays, a plan is developed which is: the team should allocate additional work time, sensible distribution of work, and additional resources, as do multi-tasking and merge those activities to complete them before the due date. Also, consider changing the analysis approach, from the current approach if it is too time-consuming so as to complete visualization on time.
